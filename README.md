# metamonument
Collaboration avec l'artiste Oli Sorenson - 2025

Initial idea:
# OBJECTIVE
Give me a modern html, css, and js (vanilla) website with maximum reach and SEO. IT has to be durable, robust, futureproof, sleek looking, while remaining simple and lightweight. 

# STRUCTURE
The structure should make it easy to add new html component. This cannot rely on any framework as the goal is to have a website as durable, futureproof and efficient as possible. you can still divide everything into .css .html and .js files. Media content such as NFT previews (.jpg, .gif, and .mp4) will be linked and IPFS links should be compatible. The website should provide a way to buy the NFTs, which should either be hosted on a platform or self lazy-minted (for these two choices, provide insight). Each video should have an original source and a fallback, they autoplay, are muted and loop.

# METADATA
Also provide all the necessary metadata in the head component. It should consider that there's both a website called metamonument.io, which is the main website, and a metamonument.net. This is the same website with an alias. it should also take OpenGraph and Artsdata metadata. It has to be strongly structured for semantic web. Google Analytics will be used.

# STYLE
additionally, suggest and add two different fonts that would look sleek with this design. they should be free. The website has a design that has a range of different size divs with parallax, these divs should appear to be floating, be semi-transparent and with a frosted glass look, round corner, modern sleek design. Should be inspired from awwwards style website and Apple looking softwares. Also, get inspired from website such as cargo collective and other highly rated designer websites.

some divs/blocks will also be in the background and not like the other ones. parallax effect in front of a background being static, while blocks in front go in front of it. Those blocks should hide the background when it changes.

The top layer divs with parallax should have different speeds in relation to the scrolling.

Also, provide a lightweight (less then 1mb) library to attach some videoframes to scroll. The goal for these frames is to map the scrolling to a video's playback.
